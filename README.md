Optimising Port Pilot Routes and Trips
Led a team of 5 in a Summer School project to design a digital solution for optimizing port pilot scheduling, integrating AIS data, weather APIs, and AI tools using design thinking (ADT4Blue Challenge #OC2-PA-C11).
Managed daily Agile sprints with Jira, created Tableau visualizations, and co-authored a 2,721-word white paper, reducing delays by 14% and enhancing sustainability.
